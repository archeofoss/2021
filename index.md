# **Call for Papers and Workshops**

## ArcheoFOSS XV | 2021

Due to the global coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, the 15th edition of the international conference ArcheoFOSS Open Software, hardware, processes, data, and formats in archaeological research will be held online on November 23rd - 26th, 2021. The official conference languages are English and Italian.

The conference will address a range of important topics and themes relating to data sharing, open tools, processes and formats in the archaeological domain.
We invite scholars, independent researchers, institutions, freelance archaeologists, and professional companies involved in Cultural Heritage to submit original research or case studies by exposing the latest trends, theoretical or practical developments and challenges in the field. On behalf of the Scientific Committee 2021 (link), the Organising Committee encourages abstract proposals focused on the following thematic areas.

## Main item. FLOSS in archaeology for the post-pandemic times

The main topic of the conference aims to cover the present condition of archaeological work and the effects that the current pandemic has caused on “traditional” workflows in Archaeology.

Potential topics may answer the following (not exclusive) questions:

1. How did the Archaeological profession change during this two-year period?
2. Are FLOSS technologies and open datasets useful in this period of change, and how?
3. Have these technologies been boosted during these years, and how?
4. Have they opened new ways and solutions for the Archaeological profession and academy?
5. Are developers working towards helping archaeologists and/or promoting tourism, local communities, municipalities, and museums fighting against COVID restrictions?

# CALL FOR PAPERS

The first day of the conference will be dedicated to presenting projects and research related to the use of FLOS in Archaeology. The Organising Committee invites proposals for speeches, especially, but not limited to, the younger people of the community to give voice to new projects and ideas **(freelance developers, graduate or PhD students, research fellows, postdoctoral fellows, etc.)**.
The speech sessions will consist of 10-minute presentations, followed by 5 minutes of questions and answers.
All the abstracts will be collected and published online in the pre-proceedings volume before the conference. After the conference, all authors will be asked to submit a full paper for the complete version of the Proceedings. Proposals will be accepted after a double-blind peer-review evaluation process.

### ![icon](./images/icons/trowel.svg "Trowel") Topic 1. Use and Application of Free/Libre and Open Source (FLOS) Tools in Archaeology

This session covers aspects connected to the application of free/libre and open source tools, such as software and hardware solutions, as well as processes, in the archaeological scope.
Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

- projects and research with workflows based on the FLOS paradigm;
- methods and strategies for using FLOS in archaeology;
- management of excavation data, photographic and graphic documentation;
- 3D survey, data processing and 3D reconstructions;
- data analysis through deep learning techniques (images, point clouds, etc.);
- scientific transparency;
- innovative data publishing strategies;
- integration, through open formats, with non-archaeological workflows (geology, engineering, construction science, environmental analysis, etc.).

## Abstract Submission

Short abstracts (4000 characters max.), with a maximum of three t images, captions and a short biography of the author/authors (max. 700 characters), must be submitted through this link: https//LINK_easychair before **June, 30th 2021**. Texts and images should be made available under CC BY-ND license.

# CALL FOR WORKSHOPS

The 2021 edition of ArcheoFOSS focuses on spreading good practices, coding skills, new workflows and best practices in reusage and opening archaeological datasets.
For this purpose, the following days will be dedicated to a series of online workshops opened to the international community, covering topics described in the below topic 2 and 3. These two sessions are aimed to match with the expected audience: 2. OpenData publishers, and 3. Developers.

The attendance will be limited in number to 25-30 participants per workshop to ensure better enjoyment of the events. The Organising Committee invites proposals for practical workshops on using a specific software, the execution of a process or the creation of a mash-up. The workshop will be published on the conference program after a double-blind peer-review process.

Applicants are requested to comply with the following requirements carefully :

- The maximum duration of the workshop is 2 hours;
- The applicants should ensure all participants can follow the workshop in practical terms, opting for multi-platform environments. Furthermore, the workshop should be accessible through Linux (most popular distributions), Windows and MacOS systems;
- Applicants will have to provide a compatible working environment (software, libraries, data) or provide in advance detailed instructions to set it properly. Applicants should remain available to the registered participants before the beginning of the workshop to solve any problems in the working environment. The organisation of a follow-up session (4-5 weeks after the workshop work), with the support of the organising committee, is highly encouraged;
- Applicants and participants must agree with the video recording of the workshop and its publication through ArcheoFOSS communication channels;
- Applicants are required to provide teaching material to the ArcheoFOSS organising committee, who may publish the material on its website and/or in its public repositories.

## ![icon](./images/icons/share.svg "Share") Topic 2. Creation, Use and Promotion of Open Data and Open Formats in Archaeology

The session encompasses themes such as the creation, publication and sharing of Open Data in archaeology, including commercial software. Particular attention will be given to the development and promotion of Open Formats.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

- projects and research with open format outcomes;
- publication strategies based on Open Data and Linked Open Data (LOD);
- adoption of transparent and documented data transformation processes;
- processing, retrieving and re-publication of legacy data;
- long term archiving and storage strategies for Cultural Heritage data through open formats;
- usage of Open Data and Open Formats for public engagement in Museums and Archaeology.

## ![icon](./images/icons/gears.svg "Gears") Topic 3. Development and Customization of FLOS Software and Hardware Solutions for Cultural Heritage

The session hosts papers dedicated to the development and customisation of free/libre and open source tools, with a special focus on software and hardware components and their effect on data, formats and processes.

Potential topics include, but are not limited to:

- creation of hardware/software tools for data modelling and integration;
- creation of hardware/software solutions for data collection in the field of Cultural Heritage;
- development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning solutions;
- open hardware framework for data management;
- development of software/hardware Internet of Things (IoT) tools for Cultural Heritage.

## Workshop Submission

The proposal (4000 characters max.), which shall include a detailed description of the practical purposes of the workshop and detailed information on required hardware/software configuration, together with a short biography of the author/authors (max. 700 characters), must be submitted through this link:
https//LINK_easychair until **June 30th 2021**, the response will be sent to the authors on - The authors of the selected papers can modify the submitted abstract until **September 1st,2021**.
